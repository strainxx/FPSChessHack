# FPSChessHack

This is my internal dll for FPS Chess.


There is a lot of bugs, maybe i'll fix them.

Critical bugs:
1. Rare crashes

I dont want to provide compiled version so compile it yourself.

# Updating
Just generate new SDK with [Dumper-7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7) and update steam overlay sigs (if needed)

# Functions
1. ESP
2. Tracers (Buggy)
3. Aim bot

# Screenshots
